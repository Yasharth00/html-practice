CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
CSS Style - Made up of CSS rules 
Rules - Made up of 2 parts {"selector" and a "declaration" block}
Syntax : selector {
    property: value;
}
i can use <div></div> element for style part by giving it an id attribute with some value and then using #id_value for styling in CSS filee
commenting in css - syntax : /* comment */
use width to change the area/size of the element wrt to the parent body
use margin with auto value to adjust the margins of an element automatically with the body 
i can put an background image but using background-image property and setting a url as the value (NOTE: the value should be in the format url(THE_IMAGE_URL);)  
<article> element - contains mutliple elements that have realted information
display: inline-block - it uses the width value to orient the elements instead of the text-align property
Styling the p elements as inline-block and placing them on separate lines creates an extra space to the right of the first p element, causing the second one to shift to the next line.
One way to fix that is to make each p element's width slightly less than 50%. So, change the width value to 49% for each class to see what happens.But there will be still some space left to the right of the price element so to fix that 
use backsapce and move the p element with pice class to the p element with flavor class such that there is no space between them and then change the width of both the elements to 50%
You can add a fallback value for the font-family by adding another font name separated by a comma. Fallbacks are used in instances where the initial is not found/available. By using comma.
The <address> element in HTML is used to define contact information for the author, owner, or organization associated with a document, article, or section of a webpage.
<hr> element is used to display a divide line between sections of different content (its a void element)
The default value of a property named border-width is 1px for all edges of hr elements. By changing the border to the same color as the background, the total height of the line is 5px (3px plus the top and bottom border width of 1px).
padding pads the elements nested inside that elemet/class wrt the parent element/class.
i can also style the anchor element <a> by chaning the color of the link using color property
i can change the color of the link when its been visited by, sytanx - a:visited {property_name: value}
I change the properties of a link when the mouse hovers over them by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:hover { propertyName: propertyValue; }.
i change the properties of a link when the link is being clicked by using a pseudo-selector that looks like a:active { propertyName: propertyValue; }.
img elements are "like" inline elements.
To make the image behave like block-level elements such as headings, create an img type selector. Set the display property to block, and use margin-left and margin-right properties to center it horizontally.
It would be nice if the vertical space between the h2 elements and their associated icons was smaller. The h2 elements have default top and bottom margin space, so you could change the bottom margin of the h2 elements to say 0 or another number.
There is an easier way, simply add a negative top margin to the img elements to pull them up from their current positions. Negative values are created using a - in front of the value.
to make the the page compatible with all devices add <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /> in the head element
i can remove the underlines from all the links using a{text-decoration: none;}
inline styles have a higher specificity than type selectors.Following this, ID selectors have a high level of specificity.Next, class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo-classes come into play.
Examples include class selectors such as .container and .button, attribute selectors like [type="text"], and pseudo-classes such as :hover. These have a moderate level of specificity.Type selectors, such as div and h1, and pseudo-elements like ::before and ::after, have a lower specificity compared to the previous groups.
Finally, the universal selector, represented by an asterisk *, has the lowest specificity of all.
example - setting the color for all elements to red using the * selector.


FLEXBOX-
box-sizing propert uses content-box and border-box
conten-box and border-box difference ??
can use text-transfor: uppercase to set the alphabets to uppercase.
remember border-bottom
padding property set to 20px 10px to create some space around the container. that is padding can contain 2 values, explore more.
always remember to give width and max width to the elemets 
margin: 0 auto is used to center the element.
Notice how some of your images have become distorted. This is because the images have different aspect ratios. Rather than setting each aspect ratio individually, you can use the object-fit property to determine how images should behave.

Give your .gallery img selector the object-fit property and set it to cover. This will tell the image to fill the img container while maintaining aspect ratio, resulting in cropping to fit.
The gap CSS shorthand property sets the gaps, also known as gutters, between rows and columns.( also have row-gap and column-gap properties)
The ::after pseudo-element creates an element that is the last child of the selected element. You can use it to add an empty element after the last image. If you give it the same width as the images it will push the last image to the left when the gallery is in a two-column layout. Right now, it is in the center because you set justify-content: center on the flex container.

Example:

Example Code
.container::after {
  content: "";
  width: 860px;
}
gap property in css is used to set the gap between the elements.
assign none to text-decoration to remove the underline of the href link.
letter-spacing property is used to provide spaces between the letters.
font-weight property is used to give thickness to the text.
Position: relative in CSS allows an element to be adjusted from its normal position in the document flow while still maintaining its original space.  This means the element can be shifted using top, right, bottom, or left properties, but other elements on the page will not fill the gap left behind. 
VERY IMPORTANT - we can add two classes to the same element by separating the two classes with a single space.
use text-transform to set text to uppercase.
box-shadow: 0 4px 10px white; REMEMBER THIS .
REMEMBER : line-height for p element
REMEBER the @media styling from style.css file.
One core rule to remember (write this mentally)

When something gets smaller, its surrounding space must also get smaller.
text-align DOES NOT WORK ON BLOCK ELEMENTS and only works on INLINE ELEMENTS.
Text-align works when you want to align inline content (like text, inline elements) inside a container,
while margin: auto is used to center a block element itself inside its parent.
Margin is for spacing between siblings.
Padding is for spacing between a container and its contents or surroundings.
One sentence you should remember (this is gold)

If spacing defines where a section ends, it belongs to the section — not the items inside it.
use margin: 0 auto; to center the items.

display: block;
This is subtle but important.
By default:
<img> is an inline element
Inline elements have weird spacing under them
display: block:
Removes bottom whitespace
Makes margin and width behave predictably
This is a fix, not decoration.

height: auto;
This means:
“Adjust height automatically to maintain aspect ratio”
Why this matters:
Prevents image stretching
Keeps proportions correct
Never distort images
You should almost always use this with responsive images.
use text-transform to change it to uppercase/lowercase.
height: auto --- keeps aspect ratio fixed.
overflow: hidden --- forces the images to stay inside.
What horizontal scroll means

If the page scrolls sideways even a little, something is wider than the viewport.

On mobile, the usual culprits are:

Images

Fixed widths

100vw

Negative margins

Borders + padding without box-sizing
